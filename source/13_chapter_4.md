# Alternate applications

## Introduction

Though I designed the framework around the use case of monitoring and controlling hydroponic gardens, I put a lot of time and care into making the services as extensible as possible.

Internet of things devices already make up a huge portion of internet connected devices globally. By 2021 IoT is expected to be a $276 billion dollar industry made 16 billion separate interconnected devices. A majority of these devices are, and will be, sensors because IoT is an incredibly efficient, cost-effective means of using analytics to increase productivity and ultimately decrease operating costs.

Though still very young, IoT is facilitating a number of very interesting projects in production environments. Disney, during its renovation of Disney Springs, recently built two five-level parking garages that fully leverage Internet of Things technology. Each parking spot has a small device attached to the ceiling directly above it. The device using a combination of high-power LEDs and a proximity sensor determines whether or not the parking spot is open and illuminates the LEDs so. The devices also proclaim the status of their parking spot so the total open spots per row, floor, and garage can be displayed on a number of signs to mitigate congestion and make parking much more efficient and simple.

The city of Barcleona is funding a 90 million dollar project to add a network of sensors installed throughout the city. As many as 3000 motion detecting street lights with the capability of sensing pollution and humidity have already been installed. Furthermore, they're attempting to install a network of sensors used to gather sound levels to create and urban map of noise pollution. Notably the project necessitate 1500 WiFi access points that will provide city-wide internet access for free.

The breadth applications is endless, and the number of people with access to start developing is vast because microcomputers are cheap, available, and come with active and helpful communities. However, because of the state of the industry, there are a number of key issues that hinder deployment and development. Victor was designed to solve at least some of these problems, while allowing for a deployment of multiple configurations.
